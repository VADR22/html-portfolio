<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Victor Alexis Delos Reyes, a Machine Operator for 3 years who worked hard to learn how to code and be good at it. Originally from Philippines migrated to Canada.
   I've been using computer since I was a kid, and recently a thought came a across my mind, "how does this game made and how does websites like youtube or facebook work?".
    That's how I got to know about coding and fell inlove with it.</p>
    
    <p>As a Machine Operator, There are times the machine won't just work the way you want it to and I try to look for the problem why it's not working as it's supposed to and that's one of many reasons I fell inlove with coding, figuring out why something is or isn't working properly.</p>
